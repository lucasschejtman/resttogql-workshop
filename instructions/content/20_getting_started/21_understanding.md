### The login screen

As part of the bootstrap process, a user has already been created that you can use to login.

The first screen should be presented and look like this. Use the following creadentials to authenticate (be careful, it is case sensitive).

-   Username: TestUser
-   Password: Test123!

You will see another dialog to verify the user. Don't worry about it, it has already been verified in the backend. You can just go ahead and press 'Skip'

{{% notice tip %}}
Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. We just made a User Pool, which is a secure user directory that will let our users sign in with the username and password pair they create during registration. Amazon Cognito (and the Amplify CLI) also supports configuring sign-in with social identity providers, such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0. If you'd like to learn more, we have a lot more information on the [Amazon Cognito Developer Resources page](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/dev-resources/) as well as the [AWS Amplify Authentication documentation.](https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/media/authentication_guide#federated-identities-social-sign-in)

### Lets jump into the code
Now the application is running and you can log in.  Lets open up the Cloud9 IDE and take a look at the code. The code can be found in  the directory **~/environment/resttogql-workshop/src/web/src**

### App.tsx

This is the entry point to the application.

**_withAuthenticator(HOC)_**
Now that we have our backend set up for managing registrations and sign-in, all we have done is use the _withAuthenticator_ [higher-order React component from AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/media/authentication_guide.html#using-components-in-react) to wrap our _App_ component. This takes care of rendering a simple UI for letting users sign up, confirm their account, sign in, sign out, or reset their password.

```tsx
// src/App.tsx

import Amplify from "aws-amplify";
//@ts-ignore
import { withAuthenticator } from "aws-amplify-react";
import React, { Component } from "react";

import StockTable from "./StockTable";

require("dotenv").config();

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return <StockTable />;
    }
}

export default withAuthenticator(App, false);
```

### Things to note in App.tsx

-   Imported and configured the AWS Amplify JS library

-   Imported the withAuthenticator higher order component from aws-amplify-react

-   Wrapped the App component using withAuthenticator

### StockTable.tsx

This is the screen that initially presents after login.

**Areas of Interest**

The call to the API to retrieve a list of companies

```tsx
//StockTable.tsx
async componentDidMount() {
        const session = await Auth.currentSession();
        this.setState({
            authParams: {
                headers: { Authorization: session.getIdToken().getJwtToken() },
                response: true
            }
        });

        const { data } = await API.get(API_NAME, "/company", this.state.authParams);
        this.setState({ itemData: data.Items });
    }

```

### StockDetail.tsx

This is the screen that displays the detail of each stock, which includes history and the buy and sell actions

**Areas of Interest**

```tsx
 //StockDetail.tsx
 async retrieveStock() {
    const res = 
    await API.get('companies', `/company/${this.state.id}/stock`, this.state.authParams);

    const stockData = 
    res.data.map((r: stockResponse) => ({ data: 'Today', price: Number(r._source.stockValue) }));

    this.setState({ stockData });
    }
```

Get the Current Stock price for the selected Company
( this code is also called by the AutoRefresh Button)
