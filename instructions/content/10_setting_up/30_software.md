Before you begin coding, there are a few things you need to install, update, and configure in the Cloud9 environment.

### Installing and updating

In the Cloud9 terminal, **run the following commands** to install and update some software you'll be using for this workshop:

```bash
# Update the AWS CLI
pip install --user --upgrade awscli

# Install and use Node.js v12.13.0 (to match AWS Lambda)
nvm install v12.13.0 --lts
nvm alias default v12.13.0

# Install the AWS CDK
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

These commands will take a few minutes to finish.

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. The CDK integrates fully with AWS services and offers a higher level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively. Using the CDKâ€™s library of infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic. The CDK improves the end-to-end development experience because you get to use the power of modern programming languages to define your AWS infrastructure in a predictable and efficient manner.
